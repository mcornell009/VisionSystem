Disparity Comparison:  A program for comparing the different disparities by disparity mat and by visualization in pcl either by mesh or by point cloud

OpenCV Examples:  A test bed for examples from openCV to test out different functions

JSEG is a segmentation algorithm from http://vision.ece.ucsb.edu/segmentation/jseg/ but seems to only work for one image at a time and is kinda slow.
